## Introduction

Thank you for contributing! Just a few tips here:

1. `cargo fmt` your code before opening up a PR
2. Run the test suite (e.g. `pgbench`) to make sure everything still works. The tests are in `.circleci/run_tests.sh`.
3. Performance is important, make sure there are no regressions in your branch vs. `main`.

Happy hacking!
